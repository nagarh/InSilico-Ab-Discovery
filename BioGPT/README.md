# Generating Antibody Sequences in silico with BioGPT
The existing BioGPT model has been specifically trained on the most frequently occurring V gene combinations, particularly the IGHV3-IGKV1 pair, derived from human paired antibody sequence (Fv regions only) datasets. This training enables the model to generate diverse and realistic antibody sequences in silico, closely mimicking natural antibody repertoires.The generated sequences are then modeled into three-dimensional structures using IgFold, a deep learning-based framework designed for rapid and accurate antibody structure prediction. PyRosetta is used to further enhance the quality and precision of these structures, ensuring that the modeled antibodies are both physically realistic and suitable for downstream structural and functional analyses.
